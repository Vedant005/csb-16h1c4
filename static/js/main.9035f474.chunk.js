For the first 50% of the book I was hooked as the author unfolded the mystery of quantum physics and meta-verse and how our mind forms everything around you. I really loved how the author has simplified complex physics concepts like quantum physics and dark matter. It wasn\u2019t too technical and made it a breeze reading it.

It has invented the language \u2018Newspeak\u2019 in an attempt to completely eliminate political rebellion; created \u2018Throughtcrimes\u2019 to stop people even thinking of things considered rebellious. The party controls what people read, speak, say and do with the threat that if they disobey, they will be sent to the dreaded Room 101 as a looming punishment.In 1984 The protagonist, Winston Smith, begins a subtle rebellion against the party by keeping a diary of his secret thoughts, which is a deadly thoughtcrime. With his lover Julia, he begins a foreordained fight for freedom and justice, in a world where no one else appears to see, or dislike, the oppression the protagonist opposes. Perhaps the most powerful, effective and frightening notion of 1984 is that the complete control of an entire nation under a totalitarian state is perfectly possible. If the world fell under the control of one or even multiple dictators, the future could easily become a twisted, cruel world where every movement, word and breath is scrutinised by an omnipotent, omnipresent power that no one can stop, or even oppose without the fear of death."},{name:"Hyperionn",rating:"3.9/5",description:"Hyperion is a Hugo Award-winning science fiction novel written in 1989 by author Dan Simmons.

Le Cirque des R\xeaves (The Circus of Dreams) features such wonders and 'ethereal enigmas' as a blooming garden made all of ice, acrobats soaring without a net, and a vertical cloud maze where patrons who get lost simply step off and float gently to the floor. The circus has no set schedule, appearing without warning and leaving without notice; they travel in a train disguised as an ordinary coal transport. A network of devoted fans styling themselves 'r\xeaveurs' ('dreamers') develops around the circus; they identify to each other by adding a splash of red to garb that otherwise matches the characteristic black and white of the circus tents. The magical nature of the circus is disguised under the guise of legerdemain: the illusionist truly transforms her jacket into a raven and the fortune teller truly reads the uncertain future, and both are applauded for their ingenuity."},{name:"The Way Of Kings",rating:"3.7/5",description:"The Way of Kings is an epic fantasy novel written by American author Brandon Sanderson and the first book in The Stormlight Archive series.The novel was published on August 31, 2010, by Tor Books.
